He expires for me.4 Accepted in the Well-beloved,and clothed in righteousness divine,I see the bar to heaven removed,and all Your merits, Lord, are mine.Death, hell, and sin are now subdued;all grace is now to sinners given;and lo, I plead the atoning blood,and in Your right I claim Yourheaven.",

    "hymnText": "Not what I am, O Lord, but whatThou art!that, that alone, can be my soul’strue rest;Thy love, not mine, bids fear and doubtdepart,and stills the tempest of my tossingbreast.2 Thy name is Love! I hear it from yoncross;Thy name is Love! I read it in yontomb;all meaner love is perishable dross,but this shall light me through time’sthickest gloom.3 Girt with the love of God on every side,breathing that love as heaven’s ownhealing air,I work or wait, still following my guide,braving each foe, escaping everysnare.4 ’Tis what I know of Thee, my Lord andGod,that fills my soul with peace, my lipswith song;Thou art my health, my joy, my staffand rod;leaning on Thee, in weakness I amstrong.5 More of Thyself, O show me hour byhour,more of Thy glory, O my God andLord;more of Thyself, in all Thy grace andpower;more of Thy love and truth, incarnateWord!",

    "hymnText": "Jesus, who lived above the sky,came down to be a man and die;and in the Bible we may seehow very good He used to be.2 He went about, He was so kind,to cure poor people who were blind;and many who were sick and lame,He pitied them and did the same.3 And more than that, He told them toothe things that God would have them do;and was so gentle and so mild,He would have listened to a child.4 But such a cruel death He died:He was hung up and crucified!and those kind hands that did suchgood,they nailed them to a cross of wood!5 And so He died! and this is whyHe came to be a man and die:the Bible says He came from heaven,that we might have our sins forgiven.6 He knew how wicked man had been,and knew that God must punish sin;so, out of pity, Jesus saidHe’d bear the punishment instead.",
